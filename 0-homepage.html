        <p>Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of sport competition using video
            games.Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly
            between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a
            part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by
            professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in
            popularity.By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game
            developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.</p>
